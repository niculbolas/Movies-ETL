# Movies-ETL

# Purpose of Project:
The purpose of this project was to create an SQL database from some data obtained from Wikipedia and Kaggle.  The data was extracted from CSV and Json files, transformed, and then loaded into the SQL database.  This data was intended to be used in a hackathon involving a company that wished to determine how to predict which movies are going to be a success so that they can purchase the rights for the movie to generate revenue.
